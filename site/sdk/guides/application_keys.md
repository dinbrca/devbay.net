Before you can send requests to the eBay API, you need to obtain a valid set of Application Keys. There are three keys available for use. 

<dl>
    <dt>DevID</dt>
    <dd>Your deveveloper ID. This ID is unique to each developer that registers with the eBay Developers Program.</dd>
    <dt>AppID</dt>
    <dd>Your application ID. This is unique to each application that you create. Of all the keys this will be the one that you will use the most.</dd>
    <dt>CertID</dt>
    <dd>Your certificate ID. A special value that is used when obtaining an authentication token from an eBay user.</dd>
</dl>

Application keys serve the following purposes:

  - They identify which developer and application is making the API requests.
  - They verify that the developer or application is allowed to make the API requests that they are using.
  - They ensure that the developer or application is authorized to make API requests on behalf of an eBay user.
