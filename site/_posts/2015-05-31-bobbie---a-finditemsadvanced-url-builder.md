I am pleased to announce a new tool for users of [findItemsAdvanced](http://developer.ebay.com/DevZone/finding/CallRef/findItemsAdvanced.html) in the eBay Finding API. Inspired by a [post](https://forums.developer.ebay.com/questions/11735/how-do-i-find-the-reference-id-of-a-product.html) from the eBay developers forum, I decided to create [Bobbie](/developers/tools/bobbie/). Enter your App ID and request values and [Bobbie](/developers/tools/bobbie/) will automatically *build* a URL that can be used in the browser or your projects.
