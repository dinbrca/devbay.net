To help keep you informed and up to date I have been working on few things that I can now announce.

## Public Roadmap

What I hope will be of the most use to you is that the roadmap for the SDK is now available as a [public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/dyrXXE3d/ebay-sdk-for-php-roadmap). This aims to be the go-to place where you can see what features I'm currently working on. A [guide to how the roadmap works](https://trello.com/c/7cC41Kr6/1-find-out-how-the-roadmap-works-please-click) is available but to summarise the features move from left to right until they are released. The great thing about using a Trello board is that it gives you the chance to vote on upcoming features. I hope you make use of this as it will aid in prioritising what to work on.

## Monthly Releases

As I progress with the development of the SDK it is important that versions are released in a consistent manor. Therefore it has been decided that there will be two release cycles.

- A new version will be released when the SDK is required to be updated due to a new API been released by eBay. These updates will be applied to current code base and will not introduce any new features or bug fixes. These updates will result in a new version number and will normally be released a few days after the latest API is made available.
- During the first weekend of each month any completed features and fixes will be bundled together in a new release. The roadmap and [dedicated Github milestone](https://github.com/davidtsadler/ebay-sdk/milestones/Monthly%20Release%20Backlog) will inform you as to what to expect in a release and as always the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/davidtsadler/ebay-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) will be updated. In the event that an API release coincides with a monthly release I will combine them into a single monthly release.

## Blog

Last but not least is the very blog that you are reading. I hope to use this as a way of informing you of upcoming features that may be of interest. The idea is that the blog can be used to go into more depth about a feature than the roadmap can. A [RSS](http://devbay.net/blog/rss.xml) feed is available should you wish to subscribe.
