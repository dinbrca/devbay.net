        <p>
              This site was created by me, <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.author_twitter }}" rel="nofollow">David T. Sadler</a>, for the purpose of supporting the eBay SDK for PHP that I have developed. This is a personal project that I decided to create to make up for the lack of an official SDK for PHP. Both the site and the SDK are in no way endorsed, sponsored or maintained by eBay.
